###This program was made when i was a 2nd year student and is still continued as my 4th year project

The database crawler crawls the information of each and every restaurant from cuisines to location
and facilities provided by a restaurant. There is a Country's.txt and toStartWith.txt file provided.
The Country's.txt file specifies which countries to be crawled and toStartWith.txt file help the program 
recognize from where to resume if the program stops anywhere midway..

NB:- Please go through the toStartWith.txt and toStartWith_sample.txt and change the toStartWith.txt accordingly 
as per use.This file should be changed only for the first time. Rest of the times the program would handle...
The path of the chromedriver should be provided if using chrome...

The review crawler crawls the reviews for the restaurants.
